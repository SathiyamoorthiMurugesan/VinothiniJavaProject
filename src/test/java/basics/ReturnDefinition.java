// * When a variable or object is created inside a method, its belong to the method. No other method can use it.
//		These methods or variable's visibility ends once the holding method get executed. In order to use the variable's 
//		value outside the method, we have return type concepts.
// * Whenever we use a return type in a method, store the method return value in a variable and use that variable wherever we want to use the method.
// * Whenever there is return type mentioned, at the end of method, we need to use "return" keyword, after that we should not be writing anything
//   		* means, return should be always at end of the methods 
// * Return type can be anything such as Class, primitive and non-premitive data type, String, Array, Collections and Objects too
// * So, whenever we have a method with return type, it does some work and give us some value
// * Either we can directly use the method in some other method or we assign method's return type to respective variable
// * Return keyword can have exact return type or its variable name
//	* Parameters can be methods with return type too
