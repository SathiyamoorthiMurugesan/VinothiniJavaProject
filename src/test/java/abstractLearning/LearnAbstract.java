	 * Abstract is a Class, its not an interface. abstract class should be created with keyword 'abstract'
	 * In abstract Class, we can have both abstract methods (without body) and concrete methods (with body)
	 * In normal class, we can not create a abstract methods
	 * The moment we create a abstract method in a class, the class will be converted into abstract Class
	 * It is not mandatory to have an abstract method in an Abstract class
	 * We can create either abstract methods or concrete methods or both the methods in abstract Class.
	 * We can not create object for abstract class. Because abstract Class may have abstract methods alone and 
	 * 		in that situation, object creation is useless
	 * Whenever, a Class, follows an abstract class, it will prompt to implement the unimplemented methods
	 * But an abstract class follows an interface it will NOT prompt to implement the unimplemented methods.
